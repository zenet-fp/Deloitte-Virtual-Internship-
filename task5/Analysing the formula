=@IFS(C2>20, "Highly Discriminative", C2<-20, "Highly Discriminative", C2<-10, "Unfair", C2>10, "Unfair", C2>=-10, "Fair", C2<=10, "Fair")

(Employees' 'Equality Score' is shown in column C, the lower it is the further it is away from equality, and the higher it is, the closer it is to being equal)

This is a simple IF statement which checks the cell value and compares it will hard coded values, for example, if an employee's equality score is less than -20, then this is 'Highly Discriminative'.

Such an IF statement is very simple but powerful to understanding who is being paid fairly and unfairly.
